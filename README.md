# Quantum
Some Quantum Mechanics notes. Initially a place for Latex notes (possibly ShareLatex.com) on reading the OU's module SM358 "The Quantum World"
Actually won't directly be linked up with ShareLatex.com (think I was getting mixed up with cloud9.io).
But I think I'll still use this repo for tracking changes in versions of main.tex ... I'll just have to export to here by hand!
